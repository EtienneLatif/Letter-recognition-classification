# Letter-recognition-classification
The notebooks I have used for machine learning and graph generation in my undergraduate dissertation.

I am working with the letter recognition dataset found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition

The aim of the project is to investigate the performance vs difficulty trade off for feed-forward neural networks in multi-class classification. Difficulty here refers to long training times, unstable gradient problems, difficulties in selecting the number of hidden layers/neurons, etc.

## Models

-Multinomial logistic regression <br/>
-Gaussian Naive-Bayes <br/>
-K-nearest-neighbour <br/>
-Feed forward neural network
